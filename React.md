# ðŸ“š React Basics

React is one of the most popular libraries for building modern web applications.

## 1. What is React?
React is a **JavaScript Library** that helps build **interactive user interfaces** efficiently.  
It breaks the UI into reusable components, making development faster and easier.

**Why it matters:**  
React updates only the parts of the UI that change, improving performance and user experience.

## 2. What is JSX?
- **JSX = JavaScript XML**
- A syntax extension for JavaScript that looks like HTML but works inside React.
- Makes writing UI components easier by combining JavaScript and HTML-like markup.

**Example:**
```jsx
const element = <h1>Hello, React!</h1>;
```

---

## 3. What is Component? 
- A **Component** is a reusable, independent piece of UI.  
- It can be a **function** or a **class** that returns JSX.  
- Components must follow **PascalCase naming convention** (e.g., `MyComponent`).  

**Example:**
```jsx
function Welcome() {
  return <h2>Welcome to React!</h2>;
}

export default Welcome;
```

---

## 4. What is Fragment?
- A **Fragment** allows grouping multiple elements without adding extra DOM nodes (like an extra ```<div>```)
- Useful when you want to return multiple sibling elements

**Example:**
```jsx
function App(){
    return (  
        <>
            <h1> Hi </h1>
            <p> This is inside Fragment </p>
        </>
    );
}
``` 

---

## 5. What is Props?
- **Props** = **Properties**
- Used to **pass data from Parent to Child** components
- Props are **immutable** (read-only inside child components)

**Example:**
```jsx
function Greeting(props){
    return <p> Hello, {props.name}! </p>;
}

function App(){
    return (
        <div>
            <Greeting name = "Manideep" />
            <Greeting name = "React Learner" />
        </div>
    );
}
```

---

## 6. What is Guard Operator?
- The **Guard Operator(&&)** in React is used to **conditionally render** components
- If the condition is ```true```, the **JSX** after ```(&&)``` is displayed
- If the condition is ```false```, React ignores it (renders nothing).

**Example:**
```jsx
function App(){
    const isLoggedIn = true;

    return (
        <div>
            <h2> Hello! </h2>
            {isLoggedIn && <p> You are a logged in âœ…</p>}
        </div>
    )
}
```

---

## 7. What is State & useState Hook?
- **State** is a way to store and manage changing data in a component.  
- Unlike props, state is **local** to a component and can be updated.  
- `useState` is a React Hook that lets you add state to functional components.  

**Example:**
```jsx
import { useState } from "react";

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increase</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```
---

## 8. What is Event Handling in React?
- An **event** is an action that user performs on the web page
- Examples: **Clicking a button, typing in an input, submitting a form, hovering over text**
- In React, events are similar to JavaScript DOM events but have some differences:
    - Written in **camelCase**(`onClick` not `onclick`)
    - You pass a **function** instead of string

**Example:**
```jsx
function App() {
  return (
    <button onClick={() => alert("Button Clicked ðŸš€")}>
      Click Me
    </button>
  );
}
```
