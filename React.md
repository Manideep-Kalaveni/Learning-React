# ðŸ“š React Basics

React is one of the most popular libraries for building modern web applications.

## 1. What is React?
React is a **JavaScript Library** that helps build **interactive user interfaces** efficiently.  
It breaks the UI into reusable components, making development faster and easier.

**Why it matters:**  
React updates only the parts of the UI that change, improving performance and user experience.

## 2. What is JSX?
- **JSX = JavaScript XML**
- A syntax extension for JavaScript that looks like HTML but works inside React.
- Makes writing UI components easier by combining JavaScript and HTML-like markup.

**Example:**
```jsx
const element = <h1>Hello, React!</h1>;
```

---

## 3. What is Component? 
- A **Component** is a reusable, independent piece of UI.  
- It can be a **function** or a **class** that returns JSX.  
- Components must follow **PascalCase naming convention** (e.g., `MyComponent`).  

**Example:**
```jsx
function Welcome() {
  return <h2>Welcome to React!</h2>;
}

export default Welcome;
```

## 4. What is Fragment?
- A **Fragment** allows grouping multiple elements without adding extra DOM nodes (like an extra ```<div>```)
- Useful when you want to return multiple sibling elements

**Example:**
```jsx
function App(){
    return 
    <>
        <h1> Hi </h1>
        <p> This is inside Fragment </p>
    </>
}
```
