# ðŸ“š React Basics

React is one of the most popular libraries for building modern web applications.

## 1. What is React?
React is a **JavaScript Library** that helps build **interactive user interfaces** efficiently.  
It breaks the UI into reusable components, making development faster and easier.

**Why it matters:**  
React updates only the parts of the UI that change, improving performance and user experience.

## 2. What is JSX?
- **JSX = JavaScript XML**
- A syntax extension for JavaScript that looks like HTML but works inside React.
- Makes writing UI components easier by combining JavaScript and HTML-like markup.

**Example:**
```jsx
const element = <h1>Hello, React!</h1>;
```
